# TODO List

* Setup incoming lead endpoint(s)
* Setup Stripe integration and user-subscriptions and one-off payments
* Refine interface, make all links resolvable

## Complete

* Refactor leads to use Single Table Inheritance so we can handle them differently based on lead type
* Reverse engineer the lead-assignment algorithm
